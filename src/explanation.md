### 1. Explanation of generate_codeword.cpp

---
#### How ot works:

1. Gaussian Elimination over $\mathbb{F}_2$ : We convert the parity-check matrix $H$ into Reduced Row Echelon Form (RREF) over $\mathbb{F}_2$. Each row operation is done modulo 2 (XOR instead of addition, etc.).
   
2. Pivot Columns \& Free Columns: Pivot Columns: Columns in which a leading 1 appears in the RREF. These correspond to dependent variables in the system $H \mathbf{x}^T=0$. Free Columns: Columns without pivots. Each free column corresponds to one dimension of the null space. If there are $k$ free columns, the dimension of the code is $k$.
   
3. Forming the Basis Vectors: For each free column, we set that free column variable $=1$ (and all other free columns $=$ $0)$ to form a single basis vector. We then solve for the pivot column bits using the RREF constraints (so $H \mathbf{v}^T=0$ ). Collect these $k$ vectors in a list basis.

4. Enumerating All Codewords: Every codeword in the null space is a binary linear combination of these basis vectors. We iterate over all $2^k$ bit patterns (mask) to generate each combination and produce a codeword. We store them as binary strings.

5. Return/Output: The function returns all $2^k$ codewords as a vector<string>.

#### Practical Notes:

- Exponential Output: For codes with dimension $k$, you get $2^k$ codewords. This becomes intractable for large $k$.
- If You Only Need a Basis: If enumerating all codewords is too large, you might just return the basis vectors (the list basis).
- Memory Constraints: If $k$ is big (say $>20$ ), enumerating $2^k$ codewords may be too large.
- Sorting: We sorted the final list of codewords for consistency; you can remove sort() if you don't need them in lexicographic order.
- This function thus computes and returns all codewords (the entire null space) of a given paritycheck matrix $H$ as binary strings.

### 2. Explanation of energy_barrier.cpp

---

1. Configuration Space: We treat each $n$-bit string (vector) as a node in a graph. There are $2^n$ such nodes. An edge exists between two nodes if they differ in exactly one bit.
   
2. Energy: The "energy" of a state $\mathbf{x}$ is the number of violated parity checks, energy0fState $(\mathrm{H}, \mathrm{x})$. Equivalently, this is the Hamming weight of the syndrome $H \mathbf{x}^T$ over $\mathbb{F}_2$.
   
3. Energy Barrier: The barrier is the minimal possible maximum energy along any single-bit-flip path from $\mathbf{0}$ to $\mathbf{c}_{\text {target }}$. We use a Dijkstra-like algorithm with a priority queue keyed by the "peak energy so far" for a path.
   
4. Data Structures: a. Priority Queue: We store states (peakSoFar, vector<int>), always expanding the state with the smallest peakSoFar first. b. visited: A hash map from the bitstring to the best (lowest) peak energy discovered so far. If we find a better route with a lower peak, we update it.

5. Algorithm Flow: a. Initialize with (peak = E(zeroState), zeroState). b. Pop from the priority queue, generate neighbors by flipping bits. c. For each neighbor, compute energy $=\mathrm{E}$ (neighbor), new peak $=$ max(currentPeak, energy). d. If this new peak is better than any recorded path for that neighbor, push it into the queue. e. Once we pop c_target , the associated peak is the minimal barrier.

6. Complexity: In the worst case, this can explore a significant portion of the $2^n$ states. Hence, it's only feasible for codes of relatively small length $n$. For large codes, specialized heuristics or structural properties are necessary.

7. This code precisely computes the energy barrier for classical binary codes by exploring the configuration graph with a best-first search approach. For large nn, it becomes intractable, but for moderate nn, it is a direct, correct solution.

### 3. Explanation of tensor_product.cpp

1. Dimensions
- $H_1$ is $\left(m_1 \times n_1\right)$.
- $H_2$ is $\left(m_2 \times n_2\right)$.
- The final $H_3$ has $\left(m_1 n_2+n_1 m_2\right)$ rows and $\left(n_1 n_2\right)$ columns.
2. Top Block: $H_1 \otimes I_{n_2}$
- For each "1" at $(i, j)$ in $H_1$, we place an $\left(n_2 \times n_2\right)$ identity block at row offset $\left(i \cdot n_2\right)$ and column offset $\left(j \cdot n_2\right)$.
3. Bottom Block: $I_{n_1} \otimes H_2$
- For each " 1 " in the $\left(n_1 \times n_1\right)$ identity (which occurs only on the diagonal, $i=j$ ), we copy the $\left(m_2 \times n_2\right)$ matrix $H_2$ into the sub-block at row offset $\left[m_1 n_2+i \cdot m_2\right]$ and column offset $\left(j \cdot n_2\right)$.
4. Result:

The final matrix $\mathrm{H}_3$ is formed by stacking these blocks vertically (top block first, bottom block second), giving exactly the shape
$$
\binom{H_1 \otimes I_{n_2}}{I_{n_1} \otimes H_2} .
$$
