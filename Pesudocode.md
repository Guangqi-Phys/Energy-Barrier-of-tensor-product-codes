Below is a conceptual pseudocode to compute (or at least approximate) the energy barrier of a classical binary linear code specified by its parity-check matrix HH. The “energy barrier” here is understood in the sense often used in statistical or topological coding contexts: the minimal peak number of violated parity checks (“energy”) along any path from the ground state (all parity checks satisfied) to a target logical state (a codeword representing a logical operation).

---

#### Overview

1. Code Setup:
- You have a parity-check matrix $H$ of size $\ell \times n$, over $\mathbb{F}_2$.
- $n$ : length of the code (number of bits).
- $\ell$ : number of parity checks (rows in $H$ ).
- A codeword $\mathbf{c} \in \mathbb{F}_2^n$ satisfies $H \mathbf{c}^T=\mathbf{0}$ (all checks satisfied).
- The ground state can be taken as $\mathbf{0}^n$ (the all-zero codeword).
- A logical operator or target codeword $\mathbf{c}_{\text {target }}$ is a nontrivial codeword representing the logical operation you care about.

2. Energy Definition:
- Define the energy of a bitstring (state) $\mathbf{x} \in\{0,1\}^n$ as
$$
E(\mathbf{x})=\text { the number of violated parity checks }=\left\|H \mathbf{x}^T\right\|_0
$$ 
- $\|\cdot\|_0$ counts the number of ones in the resulting syndrome $H \mathbf{x}^T$.

1. Energy Barrier:
- We want a path of single-bit flips from $\mathbf{0}$ to $\mathbf{c}_{\text {target }}$ whose maximum energy encountered along the path is minimal. Formally, we define the energy barrier as
$$
\Delta\left(\mathbf{c}_{\text {target }}\right)=\min _{\substack{\mathbf{x}_0=\mathbf{0} \rightarrow \mathbf{x}_1 \rightarrow \cdots \rightarrow \rightarrow \rightarrow \\ \mathbf{x}_{t+1}=\mathbf{x}_t \oplus \mathbf{e}_{i_t}}} \max _{\text {target }} \max _{0 \leq t \leq F} E\left(\mathbf{x}_t\right) .
$$
- This $\Delta\left(\mathbf{c}_{\text {target }}\right)$ is the "energy barrier" for reaching that particular codeword $\mathbf{c}_{\text {target }}$.

#### Pseudocode

High-Level Idea:
Use a shortest-path–style algorithm in the “configuration graph” whose vertices are all 2n2n bitstrings, with edges representing single-bit flips. But instead of summing edge costs, we track the peak energy encountered on any path. A typical approach is to do a modified **Dijkstra** or **BFS** that prioritizes paths by their current maximum energy.

```pesudocode
INPUT: 
    H          # Parity-check matrix (size ℓ x n) over F2
    c_target   # Target codeword in the code (H * c_target^T = 0)
               # For a "logical operator," c_target is a nontrivial codeword

FUNCTION Energy(x):
    # Compute number of violated checks for state x
    syndrome = H * x^T  (in F2)
    return the number of 1’s in syndrome

ALGORITHM ComputeEnergyBarrier(H, c_target):
    # We'll use a priority queue (min-heap) where each entry is (maxEnergySoFar, state).
    # 'maxEnergySoFar' is the peak energy encountered along the path from 0^n to 'state'.
    
    let visited = a dictionary or map from state -> bestKnownMaxEnergy
    initialize visited with visited[0^n] = 0
    
    create a priority queue pq
    pq.push( (0, 0^n) )   # (maxEnergySoFar=0, initial state=all-zero string)
    
    WHILE pq is not empty:
        (currPeak, currState) = pq.pop()   # pop the entry with the smallest 'currPeak'
        
        # If we've reached c_target, then currPeak is the minimal possible barrier
        if currState == c_target:
            return currPeak
        
        # If there's already a better path to currState, skip
        if visited[currState] < currPeak:
            continue
        
        # Explore neighbors by flipping each bit
        FOR i in 0..(n-1):
            nextState = currState XOR e_i   # flip bit i
            eNext = Energy(nextState)
            nextPeak = max(currPeak, eNext)
            
            # If nextState not visited or found a lower peak path:
            if nextState not in visited OR visited[nextState] > nextPeak:
                visited[nextState] = nextPeak
                pq.push( (nextPeak, nextState) )
    
    # If we exhaust pq without finding c_target, something is off (shouldn't happen if c_target is in the code)
    return "ERROR: c_target unreachable."
```

#### Explanation of the Algorithm

1. Configuration Graph: Each vertex (state) in the graph is an $n$-bit string. Two vertices are adjacent if they differ in exactly one bit (a single-bit flip).
 
2. Priority (CurrPeak): We maintain a priority queue ordered by the current path's maximum energy so far ( currPeak ). Whenever we explore a neighbor state via a flip, we compute the neighbor's energy ( eNext ) and update the path's peak energy as nextPeak = max(currPeak, eNext).

3. Visited Map: We store, for each encountered state, the lowest peak energy encountered so far to reach it. This pruning ensures we don't re-explore states via strictly worse (higher peak) paths.

4. Termination: Once we pop the target codeword c_target from the priority queue, the associated currPeak is guaranteed to be the minimal possible barrier. This is analogous to Dijkstra's shortest path logic-but instead of summing weights, we take the maximum (the path "cost" is the peak energy along that path).

5. Complexity: Worst-case, we might explore up to all $2^n$ states (for large $n$, this is exponential, so it's only feasible for small or moderate $n$ ). For codes with special structure or smaller dimension, this approach is manageable. For large codes, one needs specialized heuristics or approximations.

---

#### Comments and Variations
- Multiple Target Codewords: If you want the energy barrier for any nontrivial logical operator, you might run the above procedure for each representative codeword of interest or use more sophisticated enumerations (e.g., searching all codewords of minimal distance).

- Quantum or Topological Codes: For quantum stabilizer codes or topological codes, the notion of "energy" might track the number of violated stabilizers or plaquettes. The pseudo code can be adapted similarly, but the dimension of the state space might become $2^n \cdot 2^n$ if you consider X/Z operators, etc. Additional symmetries or geometry might help reduce complexity.

- Heuristics: For larger codes (e.g., LDPC), the above BFS/Dijkstra-like approach can be too large. One may use heuristic search, local moves, or message-passing to find an approximate minimal barrier. But the provided pseudo code is the conceptual exact approach.

---

#### Takeaway

**Pseudocode Summary**: We treat each bitstring as a node in a configuration graph, use a priority queue ordered by the path's maximum energy encountered, and expand neighbors by flipping one bit at a time. The first time we extract the target codeword from the queue, its associated "peak energy so far" is the minimal energy barrier.

#### Compute the logical operators of a classical binary linear code

Below is a conceptual pseudocode that computes the null space (over $\mathbb{F}_2$ ) of a given paritycheck matrix $H$. The null space corresponds to all codewords (logical operators) $\mathbf{x}$ that satisfy $H \mathbf{x}^T=\mathbf{0}$ in $\mathbb{F}_2$. From the returned basis, you can generate all codewords by taking every possible linear combination of these basis vectors.

#### Explanation of the Algorithm

1. Gaussian Elimination $(\bmod 2)$ : We convert $H$ into a row echelon form (REF) over $\mathbb{F}_2$. Each pivot column will correspond to a "dependent" variable, and columns without pivots are "free" variables.
   
2. Pivot \& Free Columns: Pivot columns: columns containing leading 1's in each row of the row echelon form. Free columns: those that do not contain a pivot. Each free column corresponds to a dimension in the code's null space.
   
3. Reduced Row Echelon Form (RREF): After we get REF, we do upward elimination to get RREF. This allows a direct reading of the relationships between pivot columns and free columns.
   
4. Construct Basis Vectors: For each free column $f c$ : We set that free variable to 1 and all other free variables to 0 , creating a single vector $\mathbf{v}$. We solve for the pivot variables from the parity-check constraints in RREF to ensure $H \mathbf{v}^T=\mathbf{0}$. Each such $\mathbf{v}$ is a basis vector for the null space. The dimension of the null space equals the number of free columns.
   
5. Generating All Codewords: Once we have the basis $\left\{\mathbf{v}_1, \ldots, \mathbf{v}_k\right\}$, all codewords (logical operators) are given by the linear combinations (over $\mathbb{F}_2$ ) of these basis vectors. If there are $k$ basis vectors, there are $2^k$ codewords in total:
$$
\mathbf{c}=\alpha_1 \mathbf{v}_1 \oplus \alpha_2 \mathbf{v}_2 \oplus \cdots \oplus \alpha_k \mathbf{v}_k, \quad \alpha_i \in\{0,1\}
$$

#### Comments and Variations

- Complexity: Gaussian elimination over $\mathbb{F}_2$ runs in $O(\ell \cdot n \cdot \min (\ell, n))$ time, which is polynomial. Enumerating all codewords from the basis is exponential in the code dimension.

- Quantum Codes: For quantum stabilizer codes, you often compute two different null spaces (one for the X-type checks, another for the Z-type checks), or combine them carefully. The method above is a classical approach but the principle of finding the null space still applies to each stabilizer generator set individually.

- Practical Usage: Usually, you store just the basis. Enumerating all codewords might be done only if $k$ (the dimension of the null space) is small.

- In conclusion, this pseudocode outlines how to find a basis for the null space of the parity-check matrix $H$ over $\mathbb{F}_2$. Each basis vector represents a fundamental logical operator. From that basis, you can generate every codeword/logical operator of the code.
